Android Distributed Prime Calculator: Gamified

How to play
===========
Install the app on your devices, preferably get a friend to do the same. Keep on clicking the find prime buttons
and see who can get the most points by calculating primes faster!

Technical Summary
=================
The way it works is that whoever calculates a prime sends it to the server on the backend (powered by Firebase - firebase.com).
Whoever finds the Nth prime first gets N^2 points awarded for their contribution.
Any user who joins the game does not need to recompute primes, but just pulls it automatically from the server to cache it locally.
